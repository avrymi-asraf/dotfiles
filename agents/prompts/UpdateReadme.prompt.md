Your task is to update the README according to the project changes.
The README is the entry point to this project. It must be useful both for humans and for agents.

1. Review the README and note which files need to be checked for changes.
2. Go through each relevant file. If it has changed, stop, update the README accordingly, then continue with the next file.

Guidelines:

* Do not reinvent the wheel. Keep the existing structure. Your role is to update, not to restructure.
* The README serves as a gateway for users, developers, and anyone who wants to understand the project. It is not a detailed implementation manual. Maintain the balance: a reader should know which file to look at for details, but not necessarily how things are implemented there.
