Generate a GitLab issue using the Gitlab mcp format. First, scan and thoroughly understand the underlying code problem or the feature based on the review. The issue content MUST be highly concise and structured into the following sections:

1. Current State: Briefly describe the existing code problem or situation.
2. Desired Change (What & Why): State precisely what needs to be altered and the fundamental reason (rationale) for the change.
3. High-Level Plan (How): Outline the necessary architectural or big-picture steps. If there is no single direct solution, briefly propose 2-3 alternative high-level strategies.

Crucial Constraint: Keep all sections extremely short and purposeful. Do not include low-level technical implementation details or fine-grained how-to instructions. Focus exclusively on what must change and why. For illustrating the plan, you may optionally use pseudo-code or simple diagrams/graphs.
